# wc-usage-tracking-auto-opt-in

**This repository is now archived. Please check future development here: https://github.com/a8cteam51/team51-tracking**

Automatically opts site into:
- WooCommerce Usage Tracking
- Sensei Usage Tracking
- Bilmur RUM data collector

This plugin would work well as an mu-plugin that is auto-loaded into new sites upon site creation.
